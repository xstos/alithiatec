Back in 2007 I wrote a few pieces of freeware.

[RapidFetch](RapidFetch3) - an alternative to autocomplete (before the windows 7 start menu search existed)<br/>
[TLJExtractor](TLJExtractor) - a tool to extract audio from the video game "The Longest Journey"<br/>
[Breakout](Breakout) - a breakout-style 2D demo game made with DirectX SDK Apr 2007<br/>
[Visual Basic 6.0 Utils](Visual Basic 6.0 Utils) - a variety of small utils I wrote for myself late 90s/early 2000s and then forgot about<br/>
[BatchImageResizer](BatchImageResizer) - a drag and drop image resizer utility I made for my mom<br />
[PBX Data CSV Diff Tool](PBX Data CSV Diff Tool) - at prairieFyre we had to dig through a lot of PBX phone-switch data, I made this personal tool to help myself diff tables<br/>
[VPNKeepAlive](VPNKeepAlive) - a utility that intermittently pings to keep VPNs from timing out<br/>
[Screenblanker](screenblanker) - covers the screen in a black window (double-click to close)<br/>
[ScholasticMaze](School/High School/ScholasticMaze (VB6)) - A video game project I made in high school using VB6.<br/>
[School/McMaster U/2SI4](School/McMaster U/2SI4) - Some C programming assignments from university.<br/>
[School/McMaster U/3E/Haskell](School/McMaster U/3E/Haskell) - Some Haskell snippets.<br/>

I am releasing the source code in case somebody finds these tools useful.

Cheers, Chris C.
