Back in 2007 I wrote a few pieces of freeware.

Dedupify - duplicate file cleanup tool<br />
RapidFetch - an alternative to autocomplete (before the windows 7 start menu search existed)<br />
TLJExtractor - a tool to extract audio from the video game "The Longest Journey"<br />
Breakout - a breakout-style 2D demo game made with DirectX SDK Apr 2007<br />

I am releasing the source code in case somebody finds these tools useful.

Cheers, Chris C.
